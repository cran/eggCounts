* Correct fec_stan help file examples (thanks to Ivailo)

* Corrected coding error with non-default prior for ziunpaired model (thanks to Anja)

version 1.3:

* Fixed bug in printing MCMC summaries for meanEPG

* Fixed implementation bug of the zero-inflation models that was in v1.2 

* Fixed minor bug in printing warnings

* Added function to compute probability of reduction based on posterior density

version 1.2:

* Allowed direct extraction of summary output

* Fixed minor bug in validating correction factors

* Fixed minor bug in converting multiple mcmc chains

* Updated citation information


version 1.1-2:  

* Updated documentation

* Removed redundant functions 


version 1.1-1:  

* Updated LinkingTo version requirements


version 1.1:  

* Updated Stan program syntax 

* Fixed minor bug in the mcmc output of the 1-sample zero-inflation model


version 1.0:  

* MCMC inference migrated from Metropolis-Hastlings algorithm and Gibbs sampler to Stan modelling language.

* Further improved bug fix of version 0.4.

* Improved models.

* Full-support on zero-inflation models.



version 0.4, 0.4-1:  

* Bug fixes introduced since version 0.1.

* Further improved bug fix of version 0.3.

* Alerts the user in case of atypical data through 'NOTE'.

* Added verboselevel functionality for detailed debugging. 

* Improved help and added tests.


version 0.3:  

* Updated package structure: NEWS, ChangeLog and CITATION files.

* Bug fix: all "zero" draws from rgamma are captured and
    set to `minrgamma=.Machine$double.eps`.
    Thus numerical results are likely to change.


version 0.2:  

* stable release on CRAN
